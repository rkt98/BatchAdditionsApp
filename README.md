# BatchAdditionsApp

The basic additions app is based of a work excel calculator for water additions to get batches to the right brix. I created the app as a temporary solution to issues with access to the calculator for temporary/ contracted staff. The calculator is vital for my work and having a version that I can use where I am working is a better solution than the alternative which would be me asking another memeber of the team to login and calculate the addition every time I test a batch. 

Currently it is only able to calculate water additions when the target is greater than the measured Brix. I plan on adding functionality to help with getting the brix back up to the target if it is too low and also addition an option to adjust the bucket capacity so if the user has a bucket with more or less capacity it can display the smaller aditions properly.

Note: Buckets are currently locked at a 13L capacity and will only show when the addition is 104L or less as anything above is better to add through a tank with a pump.
